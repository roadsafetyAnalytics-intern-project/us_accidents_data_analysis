## RoadSafe Analytics: Road Accidents - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🚗📊

### Project Overview 🎯

This project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large-scale road accidents dataset to identify trends, patterns, and key factors influencing accident severity. Leveraging Python's data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project will generate actionable insights to enhance road safety awareness and support effective policy-making.

### Project Objectives 🛠️

- ✅ Effectively preprocess real-world accident data and address data quality issues  
- 📅 Analyze accident frequency with respect to time, location, weather, and road conditions  
- 📈 Visualize patterns related to accident severity using diverse plotting techniques  
- 💡 Extract meaningful insights to inform traffic safety interventions and policymaking  
- 📝 Document the methodology, findings, and recommendations comprehensively  

### Dataset 📁

We will utilize the **US Accidents Dataset** from Kaggle: [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)  
This dataset contains over 4 million accident records encompassing attributes such as timestamps, geolocation, severity levels, weather conditions, road surface state, and visibility metrics.

### Key Modules & Workflow 🛠️🚦

1. Dataset Acquisition and Initial Exploration  
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
3. Univariate Data Analysis  
4. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis  
5. Geospatial Analysis and Visualization  
6. Insight Extraction and Hypothesis Testing  
7. Comprehensive Visualization and Interpretation  
8. Final Documentation and Presentation Preparation

### Project Timeline & Milestones 📅

**Milestone 1**  
**Week 1: Project Initialization & Dataset Acquisition 🏁**  
- Define project goals and expected deliverables  
- Download and familiarize with the dataset structure, schema, and summary statistics  
- Assess data completeness, types, and identify missing or anomalous values  

**Week 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 🧹**  
- Handle missing data by imputation or removal of columns with excessive gaps  
- Convert and parse datetime columns appropriately  
- Engineer new temporal features like Hour, Weekday, and Month  
- Encode categorical variables where necessary  
- Detect and manage outliers and duplicate entries  

**Milestone 2**  
**Week 3: Univariate Analysis 📊**  
- Investigate distribution of accident severities  
- Analyze trends across time variables (hourly, daily, monthly)  
- Examine dominant weather conditions and road types linked with accidents  
- Utilize histograms, pie charts, and bar plots for visualization  

**Week 4: Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis 🔍**  
- Explore relationships between severity and factors like weather, visibility, road conditions, and traffic congestion  
- Use heatmaps, boxplots, and pair plots to reveal correlations and patterns  

**Milestone 3**  
**Week 5: Geospatial Analysis 🌍**  
- Map accident locations using latitude and longitude data  
- Identify accident hotspots on scatter and density maps across states and cities  
- Highlight most accident-prone regions by frequency  

**Week 6: Insight Extraction & Hypothesis Testing 🧠**  
- Address specific queries, e.g.,  
  - Peak accident times of day ⏰  
  - Impact of rain or fog on severity 🌧️🌫️  
  - Correlation between visibility and accident severity 🔎  
- Document hypotheses, perform statistical tests, and summarize findings  

**Milestone 4**  
**Week 7: Final Visualization & Storytelling 📚**  
- Integrate findings into coherent narratives using clear and impactful visuals  
- Refine graphs and interpretations for presentation clarity  

**Week 8: Documentation & Presentation Prep 📝🎤**  
- Compile detailed reports outlining methods, analyses, insights, and recommendations  
- Develop a polished presentation emphasizing key takeaways  
- Prepare for presenting and discussing results with stakeholders

# Add few steps like download the dataset from this source, extract the dataset from zip and move to data folder in the project, after cloning, change the directory, like these.

Here is the updated "Quick Load the App" section with detailed steps for downloading, extracting, and organizing the dataset:

### Quick Load the App 🚀

To quickly launch the RoadSafe Analytics app, follow these complete steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roadsafetyAnalytics-intern-project/us_accidents_data_analysis.git
cd us_accidents_data_analysis/Project
```

2. **Download the Dataset:**

- Visit the dataset page: [US Accidents (2016-2023) on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
- Click "Download" (you'll need to sign in to Kaggle)
- The dataset will download as a ZIP file named `US_Accidents.csv.zip`

3. **Extract and Organize the Dataset:**
```bash
# Create data directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p data

# Extract the ZIP file (on Windows, you may need to use a tool like 7-Zip or extract manually)
# On macOS/Linux, use:
unzip US_Accidents.csv.zip -d data/

# Or if the ZIP file is in another location, specify the path:
# unzip ~/Downloads/US_Accidents.csv.zip -d data/
```

4. **Set Up the Python Environment:**

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. **Verify Data Placement:**

Ensure your project structure looks like this:

```
Project/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── data/
│   └── US_Accidents.csv
└── ...
```

7. **Launch the App:**

Run the following command to start the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`. You can then interact with the dashboards and explore the accident data.

**Note**: If you encounter any issues with the Kaggle download, you may need to:

- Accept the dataset terms on Kaggle
- Install the Kaggle CLI: `pip install kaggle`
- Configure your API credentials following Kaggle's instructions
- Download via command line: `kaggle datasets download -d sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents`[^1]
